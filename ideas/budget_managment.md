# Budget Management Application

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and specifications for a budget management application. The application will provide core functionalities for user management, transactions, and balance reporting.

## Features

### User Management

- **User Creation:**
  - Create new user accounts with unique `username`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and an initial `balance` of 0.
- **User Retrieval:**
  - Retrieve user information based on `username`.

#### Transaction Management

- **Deposit Funds:**
  - Allow users to deposit funds into their accounts.
  - Update user's `balance` accordingly.
  - Validate deposit amount as a positive numeric value.
- **Transfer Funds:**
  - Enable users to transfer funds between accounts.
  - Validate sufficient balance for the sender.
  - Update `balance` for both sender and receiver.
  - Validate transfer amount as a positive numeric value.

#### Reporting

- **Top Users:**
  - Retrieve and display the top 3 users with the highest balances.
  - Handle cases where there are fewer than 3 users.

### User Model

The `User` model should have the following properties:

- `username`: Unique identifier for the user (string)
- `firstName`: User's first name (string)
- `lastName`: User's last name (string)
- `balance`: User's current balance (number)

**Example User Object:**

```json
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "balance": 1500.75
}
```

### Additional Considerations

- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for scenarios such as insufficient balance, invalid user input, and unexpected system errors.

- Data Persistence: Ensure user data and transaction history are stored persistently for data recovery and analysis.

- Security: Protect user data with appropriate security measures, including data encryption and access controls.

- User Interface: Consider a user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

By adhering to these specifications, the budget management application can effectively manage user finances and provide valuable insights into spending habits.
