### Prerequisite

Before contributing to this project, it's recommended to read the [Getting Started with open source](https://github.com/gabrieldemarmiesse/getting_started_open_source/tree/master) guide. This guide will familiarize you with the basics of open source contribution and Github workflows.

### About the Project

In today's rapidly evolving tech landscape, staying up-to-date with the most demanded technical skills is crucial. This community aims to:

- Provide curated learning paths for various technical skills.
- Offer real-world projects to practice and apply new skills.
- Connect students with mentors and industry professionals.
- Foster a supportive and collaborative learning environment.

### Directory Structure

- `ideas`: Contains ideas to be implemented. This directory holds various project ideas, concepts, and proposals that can be picked up by contributors for implementation.
- `projects`: Contains implementations of the ideas. This directory includes the actual project files and code for the ideas that have been turned into fully realized projects.

### Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone passionate about helping students succeed in the tech industry. Here's how you can contribute:

- **Project Ideas:** Contribute project ideas and resources that students can work on to build their portfolios.
- **Mentorship:** Offer your expertise as a mentor to guide students on their learning journey.
- **Code Reviews:** Share constructive feedback on code projects and contribute to a supportive learning environment.

### Contribution Guidelines

If you are contributing to a project, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Pull Request Title:** Add the name of the project idea from the `/ideas` folder to the title of your pull request.

2. **Project Directory Naming:**

   - Create a new directory inside the `projects` directory for your point of interest project.
   - Name the directory following this pattern: `<idea_name>_<github_username>`, where:
     - `<idea_name>` matches the name of the project idea from the `/ideas` folder.
     - `<github_username>` is your GitHub username.

   For example, if you're implementing the project idea "build-a-calculator" and your GitHub username is "johndoe", the directory name would be `build-a-calculator_johndoe`.

3. **High-Level Diagram:** It is recommended to include a high-level diagram explaining your solution in the pull request description.
